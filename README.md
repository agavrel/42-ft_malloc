"Design patterns have already made an important contribution to the development of object technology, and as new ones continue to be published they will help developers to benefit from the experience of their elders and peers. How can the general idea contribute to reuse? Design patterns should not encourage a throwback to the “all that counts is design reuse” attitude mentioned earlier. A pattern that is only a book pattern, however elegant and general, is a pedagogical tool, not a reuse tool; after all, computing science students have for three decades been learning from their textbooks about relational query optimization, Gouraud shading, AVL trees, Hoare’s Quicksort and Dijkstra’s shortest path algorithm without anyone claiming that these techniques were breakthroughs in reusability. In a sense, the patterns developed in the past few years are only incremental additions to the software professional’s bag of standard tricks. In this view the new contribution is the patterns themselves, not the idea of pattern."
Approaches to Reusability in Object Oriented Software Construction by Meyer

"This opened my mind, I started to grasp what it means to use the tool known as algebra. I’ll be damned if anyone had ever told me before: over and again Mr. Dupuy [the mathematics teacher] was making pompous sentences on the subject, but not once would he say this simple word: it is a division of labor, which like any division of labor produces miracles, and allows the mind to concentrate all of its forces on just one side of objects, on just one of their qualities.
What a difference it would have made for us if Mr. Dupuy had told us: This cheese is soft or it is hard; it is white, it is blue; it is old, it is young; it is yours, it is mine, it is light or it is heavy. Of so many qualities let us consider only the weight. Whatever that weight may be,
let us call it A. Now, without thinking of the weight any more, let us apply to A everything that we know of quantities.
Such a simple thing; yet no one was saying it to us in that faraway province…"
